# TODO for Fixing Panel Data Load Error and Testing

## Completed
- Fixed date calculation bug in backend/services/scraper/fetch_live_data.py by replacing incorrect datetime.replace(day=day+4) with timedelta(days=4).
- Verified backend scraping logic in dpbossScraper.js and Python script for live data extraction.

## Pending Testing
- Critical-path testing of the panel page (https://dpboss.boston/panel-chart-record/main-bazar.php) and related frontend components.
- Testing /api/results/fetch-latest and related backend endpoints for correct data fetching and error handling.
- Verify that the fixed scraper script correctly fetches and returns valid data.
- Confirm frontend error handling and UI updates on data fetch success/failure.

## Next Steps
- Ask user if they want me to perform critical-path testing or thorough testing.
- Test frontend panel page and related components.
- Test backend /api/results/* endpoints including scrapeLatest and getLiveExtracted.
- Fix any additional bugs or issues found during testing.
- Finalize and complete the task.
